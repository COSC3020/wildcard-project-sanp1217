# Pancake Sort

Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

    Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
    Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr.
